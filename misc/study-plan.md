# Study Plan

This guide is based on the study plan document provided by alvaroszi, the book mentioned is on '/misc/books/'

Book: The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena

> [!NOTE]
> All the bullet points that have numbers like `2.2`, `2.7`, `3.1`, etc are chapters from the book.<br/>
> So `2.2` refers to chapter 2, section 2 and so on.

- `2.2` - `2.7` (16 pages)
- `3.1` (6 pages)
