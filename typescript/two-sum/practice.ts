/**
 * @tag Array; Hash Table
 ***************************************************************************
 * Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a
 * specific target number. The function twoSum should return indices of the two
 * numbers such that they add up to the target, where the first must be less
 * than the second.
 *
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 *
 * Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: Because numbers[0] + numbers[1] == 9, we return [0,1]
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
 * Output: [1,2]
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
 * Output: [0,1]
 *
 * Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?
