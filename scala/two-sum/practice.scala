  *
  * Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a
  * specific target number. The function twoSum should return indices of the two
  * numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than
  * index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are
  * not zero-based.
  *
  * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution. Input
  * numbers = { 2, 7, 11, 15 }, target = 9 Output [0, 1]
